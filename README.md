## Books
- [The Lean Startup](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004J4XGN6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004J4XGN6&linkCode=as2&tag=theartofproma-20) by [Eric Ries](https://twitter.com/ericries). One of the worst things a PM can do is build a product that nobody wants.  This book shows you how to avoid that by building a minimum viable product and paying attention to the metrics that matter.
- [The Design of Everyday Things](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E257T6C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00E257T6C&linkCode=as2&tag=theartofproma-20) by [Don Norman](http://www.jnd.org/). *The Design of Everyday Things* shows that good, usable design is possible. The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right time. [From a product designer's perspective](http://pmblog.quora.com/The-10-Books-Every-Product-Manager-Should-Read), "I consider this the canonical product design book, and it's a great place for anyone to start, especially if you don't already have a background in design. It will show you how to look at the world in terms of design. *After reading this book you'll start to notice good and bad designs all around you.*"
